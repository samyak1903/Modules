Q.1- What is Time Tuple?
Ans.1- We can represent the time in a way that’s easy for us to understand. However, Python stores it in tuples. These python tuples are made of nine numbers.
This tuple has an equivalent struct_time structure.

Index	Field	            Domain of Values
0	Year (4 digits)	    Ex.- 1995
1	Month	            1 to 12
2	Day	            1 to 31
3	Hour	            0 to 23
4	Minute	            0 to 59
5	Second	            0 to 61 (60/61 are leap seconds)
6	Day of Week	    0 to 6 (Monday to Sunday)
7	Day of Year	    1 to 366 (Julian day)
8	DST	            -1,0,1

Python strptime() parse a string representing a time according to a format. The strptime() takes a string and parses it. Finally, it returns a time tuple.

Example:
>>> import time
>>> time.strptime("30 Nov 00", "%d %b %y")   
time.struct_time(tm_year=2000, tm_mon=11, tm_mday=30, tm_hour=0, tm_min=0,
                 tm_sec=0, tm_wday=3, tm_yday=335, tm_isdst=-1)
